# spotify-player
Microphone audio visualiser with Spotify integration written in React and Node.js
- Spotify integration - the permissions required allow the app to search for and play tracks
- Custom built scrubber - no third-party libraries used
- Custom built microphone audio visualiser written in native JavaScript using HTML Canvas - no third-party libraries used

### NOTE: I'm no longer hosting the app as it needs to go through a manual approval process from Spotify to allow it to go live, otherwise it'll be stuck in developer mode and no one will be able to log in with their Spotify account. I may turn this into something else at some point...
